# Restaurant-and-cafe-application
I am a junior programmer, and this is a beta version of my app.
If you want to use.
You have to follow a small procedure.
1. Download XAMPP from the Internet.
2. Install XAMPP, during installation select MySQL server.
3. Folder restaurant_system, is a folder with the necessary files from the database.
Go to the xammp folder, located in some local disk on your computer that you selected during installation. Open the mysql folder, and paste restaurant_system into the data folder.
4. Start Apache and MySQL, then launch the application.

 The serial number must be entered manually on the client part. Because each cafe or restaurant can use a different combination of letters and numbers.
